# euroavia-simulations
Matlab simulations made for the 2025 edition of the euroavia competition.

Flying Fish assumptions:
Rocket body diameter is 0.08 m.
Rocket body mass is 0.75 kg.
After apogee the vector falls 5 meters before assuming a state of glide.
Glide ratio (altitude drop to horizontal distance traversed) after apogee is 1:3.

PaIRS assumptions:
Rocket body diameter is 0.10 m.
Rocket body mass is 1.00 kg.
After apogee the vector instantly assumes a state of glide.
Glide ratio (altitude drop to horizontal distance traversed) after apogee is 1:2.

SPEAR assumptions:
Rocket body diameter is 0.06 m.
Rocket body mass is 0.50 kg.
After apogee the vector continues along a ballistic trajectory.
